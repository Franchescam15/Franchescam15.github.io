I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3, Part 1
This lab was one of my favorites because, in the previous labs, I struggled with the code, but in this lab, I started to understand how to write code better. My partner and I were struggling at first, but we asked for help, which made things easier for us to understand. I believe this was the first lab we started calculating, and it was interesting to learn and implement in our code for calculating BMR for men and women.  

Lab 9, Part 1
Out of all the labs, this was my favorite one because my partner was fun, and writing the code with him was hilarious. In part one, we created a spell-checker program and in spelling.cc we wrote words like slay, purr, Stanley, and more. It was giving us problems at first, but our instructor and TA were able to help us problem-solve to fix it.

Lab 10â€‹
This lab is another favorite of mine because it was only one part, which was pretty easy for my partner and me to complete. We were able to create a two-dimensional data structure to search through the population and county percentage of the population. This time, I did not need to ask for help since it was easy, and we used previous methods of code.
